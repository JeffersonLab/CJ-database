## Uncertainty:
*norm: 
(discard)1.9% normalization uncertainty from p143 in Liang's thesis (discard), use 1.6% normalization uncertainty according to Eric

*er_u: 
combination of statatistical uncertainty and the R-model uncertainty( diff b/w two models, see below). the systematic uncertainty is much smaller than rdiff that it is treated as zero

## Description from original data file:

 Proton F2 structure function extracted from Jefferson Lab Hal C experiment E94-110 cross sections.   
 To minimize the uncertainty on the extrapolation to epsilon = 1, F2 has been extracted using only cross sections measured at epsilon > 0.5.  The uncertainty in the extrapolation has been estimated utilizing what is effectively two different fits to the epsilon dependence of this data set.         

The two fits are:
